A simple direct input multiboxing tool, broadcasting keyboard input and supports auto focusing the windows of your choice.

The application supports any window with an identifiable name, and can make windows borderless, resize them, and more.

Not suitable for applications that require round robin or disallow direct input broadcasting.
