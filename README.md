A simple direct input multiboxing tool, broadcasting keyboard input and supporting auto-focusing the windows of your choice.

**Features:**

* **Direct Input Broadcasting:** Sends keyboard inputs to multiple windows simultaneously, through round robin refocusing on interaction or round robin looping.
* **Window Targeting:** Works with any window with an identifiable name.
* **Window Manipulation:** Ability to make windows borderless, resize them, and more.
* **Simple Setup:** Easy to configure and use.
* **Universal:** Works both with windows that listen for key input while not focused and windows that require round robin/direct focusing.

**Limitations:**

* Only works on Windows. Not suitable for Linux or MacOS.
* Not suitable for applications that disallow direct input broadcasting.
